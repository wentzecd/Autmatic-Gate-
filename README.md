# Autmatic-Gate-
Small Scale Automatic Gate System Using ATMega 328p Driver with Fingerprint Scanner, Keypad, IR remote and LCD peripheral chips

This project uses two arduino uno style protyping boards to build a small-scale embedded system. All the code for the primary board is used to compile using avr-gcc. The only 
file needed to compile the secondary board is the 387_fingerprint.h file, and it can be compile directly through arduino ide software. To compile  the main board, put all the 
remaining code in one directory and run the compile_script using python.
